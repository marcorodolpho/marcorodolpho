# Hi, I'm Marco 👋

I'm a highly motivated student and aspiring Software Engineer with strong foundations in logic, mathematics, and problem-solving. I recently completed high school and I'm currently deepening my technical skills in C programming, backend development, and computer science fundamentals.

I enjoy building practical projects, learning by doing, and continuously improving my understanding of how software works from the ground up.
